There are a following steps to make it--
In a int main() function create while loop set a true such that while(1) and inside  the loop make int variable name as choice and take user input .It depends upto U How many 
choices you can create after that make if else type block inside if call a function like newRegistration() and else case login() after declaring it make function of same name 
after that In a global make a stuct type userDetails inside it take a name,email_id and mobile no .
so, make a vector of struct that take a input of mix datetype.
make a function that you are maked in previous inside it take input name,email_id and mobile no and refer to struct typedef.name ..  so on
then push all the data in vector
again make a login function and take a input of username and email_id after by a for each loop check it valid to login or not.
